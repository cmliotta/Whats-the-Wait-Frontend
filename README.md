What's the Wait? is a mobile app commited to improving everyone's dining experience.
What's the Wait? allows restaurants to communicate individual party wait times to its patrons while easily tracking its complete wait list.

With a simple download, restaurants can manage their wait lists with ease and patrons can monitor their estimated wait time directly from their phone.

This was our final project for Dev Bootcamp, the team consisted of: gaillechua, michellepark, ruslanid, cmliotta.

In less than one week, we learned new technologies and built a decoupled app with a Rails backend and Angular & Ionic frontend. We are continuing to improve the app to make it production quality and plan to release it for iPhone and Android soon.
